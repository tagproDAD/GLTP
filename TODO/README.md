## 🛠️ Bot v1.4 – In Progress / TODO

- [ ] `ADDREPLAY` command
- [ ] Map selection stability: Ensure a launched map is the actual one played
- [ ] Map knowledge stability: Fix bot thinking the wrong map is active
- [ ] Incorporate Max Balls Record
- [ ] `@property` for central game/lobby/world state. Derive all logic from this
- [ ] `QUEUE` command:
  - `QUEUE` → list current queue
  - `QUEUE <preset>` or `QUEUE <map name>` → add to queue
- [ ] `REPLAY` → enqueue same map again
- [ ] `LAUNCHMAP <map name>` or `<map id>`
- [ ] Move AFKs to "waiting" area

---

## 🧪 Bot v1.5 – Planned Features

- [ ] Announce new WRs as they occur
- [ ] `WR`: Show "Gates Unlocked" stat
- [ ] Speedrun improvement:
  - For maps with no checkpoints, count time from spawn to cap (avoid relaunching)

---

## 🧭 Bot v1.6 – Voting & Launch Experience

- [ ] Notify: "Preparing next map: (map details)"
  - Add launch delay
  - Inform users of voting options and default behavior
- [ ] Add lobby voting:
  - `SKIP`: vote to load a random different map
  - `LAUNCH`: vote to run current map
  - `REPLAY`: vote to run previous map again
- [ ] Add in-game voting:
  - `ABORT`: vote to cancel the current game

---

## 🔮 Bot v1.X – Ideas & Future

  - [ ] `KB Interrupt`: Leave group immediately if interrupted
  - [ ] `MAP` statistics:
    - Completion Rate: `<% capped>`
    - Median Time: `<median of last 9 plays>`
  - [ ] Weigh periodic messages:
    - Based on fun rating
    - Frequency adjusted by recency
  - [ ] Exponential decay for recency:
    - `recency_score = 1` if never played
    - `0.1` if more than 24 hours ago
    - `0` if within last 24 hours
  - [ ] Detect broken group: Check `/find` without `/game`
  - [ ] Checkpoints: Allow creation of new map variant mid-game
  - [ ] Auto-tune settings based on WRs
    - e.g. `besttime: [0, 60]` by default
